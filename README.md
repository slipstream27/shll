## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/shll.git
   cd shll
   ```
2. Build the binary:
   ```sh
   make build
   ```
   The binary will be in the `bin/` directory.

   > **Note:** Official packages for Homebrew, APT, and YUM are coming soon.

3. Set your OpenAI API key:
   ```sh
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx...
   ```
4. Run shll:
   
   Once built, you can run shll from your terminal:
   ```sh
   ./bin/shll find all .txt files in this directory and count lines
   ```
   > Some shells (such as `zsh` or when using special characters) may require your prompt to be enclosed in quotes:
   > ```
   > shll "find all .txt files in this directory and count lines"
   > ```
   > 
   > **Tip:** To use `shll` without needing quotes, add this to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:
   > ```sh
   > shll() {
   >   /full/path/to/bin/shll "$*"
   > }
   > ```
   > Replace `/full/path/to/bin/shll` with the actual path to your compiled binary. After adding this, restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zshrc` (or `source ~/.bashrc`).
