            DON'T BE A DICK PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

 1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.

     Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:
       1a. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.
       1b. Modifying the original work to contain malicious content. That's VERY MUCH being a dick.
       1c. Not crediting the original source or author(s). That's ALSO being a dick.

 2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
    share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original creator(s) a beer.

 3. Code is provided as-is with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes you a dick.

 4. If you disagree with this license, you are probably being a dick.
